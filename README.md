# **Cub3D**

Cub3D is a 3D raycasting engine that renders a basic 3D environment from a 2D map, inspired by early 3D games. This project was created as part of the [42 School](https://www.42.fr/en/) curriculum and aims to demonstrate understanding of 3D rendering, raycasting, and basic game engine mechanics.

## **Introduction**

Cub3D is a 3D raycasting engine that simulates a first-person view of a 3D world based on a 2D grid map. The project utilizes raycasting, a technique commonly used in early 3D games like *Wolfenstein 3D*. It is an excellent exercise in learning how graphics, rendering, and input handling work under the hood of a game engine.
